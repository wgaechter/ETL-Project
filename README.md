# ETL-Project
# This project is comparing two different stock types

# All Stocks for the last 5 years
# Bitcoin closing stock

# Combining them to see if the bitcoin stock goes the same way as the All stocks for the last 5 years

# first the data must be cleaned as the date in bitcoin need to match the All stock

# once that was done they are then all combined into one file

# This would ensure that the date ranges showing will match

# Once done a picture will be taken of the data and placed into a Powerpoint to show how we found the data and combined the data

# We then show what the conclusion of the data is.
